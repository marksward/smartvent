# smartvent
Logger for SmartVent Evolve ventilation system.
Logs system info to database periodically (set by cron or task scheduler).
Allows tracking of what the system does as the Evolve Tablet doesn't store or display historical sensor data nor the trend on each sensor.

Looking for opportunities to extend this with web reporting etc. to enhance understadning of what the SmartVent Evolve can do.
